Currently I'm learning TypeScript, so I mostly do ${activity1}. I normally do ${activity1} from 10 AM to 4:30 PM. During this time, I also pay attention to my second activity which is ${activity2}, as ${activity2} is a really important part of a Muslim's life. I get free from my daily routine, usually, at 7:30 PM. From here, my third activity begins which is ${activity3}. I normally do the third activity for almost half an hour. Then the time for sleep comes.`;
